### 2048 game

This is a implementation of the 2048 game. It uses a 2D array to represent the game field and allows the player to slide numbered cells left, right, up, or down to merge identical cells and increase their values until they reach 2048. The game is won if a cell with a value of 2048 is reached, and the game is lost if there are no empty cells on the game field and no cells can be merged. The code defines event listeners for user input and functions to move cells, merge cells, and add new numbers to the game field.
The code uses several web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate and update the display of the game. The event listeners for user input are implemented using JavaScript's addEventListener method. The game field is represented as a 2D array, and the code uses various array manipulation methods to move and merge cells on the game field.
